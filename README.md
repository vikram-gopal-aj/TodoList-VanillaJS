### Functionality: 
*Create as many number of lists as needed to keep you sane.
*Remove those of course, duh!
*Each List can have a bunch of tasks or to-do items.
*Each task can be edited, removed and most importantly toggle DONE!
*Unless you aren't actually done and need to put it back TODO!
*Some additional functionality toggling visibility of DONE items.

### External libs: 
* Bootstrap 4
* FontAwesome 5
